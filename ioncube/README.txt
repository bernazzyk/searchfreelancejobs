legacy/                 - Encoders for producing encoded files that work with

                          Encoder release (6.5), and therefore do not have
                          features that are new in the version 7 series of
                          Encoders.


Using Encoded Files - the ionCube Loader
========================================

A free component called the ionCube Loader is provided to process encoded
files. Loaders are available for many platforms, and with ionCube technology a
widely used industry standard, many hosting servers have the Loader component
installed by default. Where it is not pre-installed then depending on the 
web server configuration, a user can either easily install it themselves, or
otherwise server administrators / hosting providers would usually do this
if required.

When the Loader Wizard PHP script is run on a web server, it will identify
which Loader pacakge and Loader is required, and give advice as to what
install steps are required. 

Loaders can be downloaded from http://loaders.ioncube.com

To get a Loader setup for yourself, simply install the Loader Wizard script
(loader-wizard.php) onto a target web server, point your browser to the 
script and follow the instructions. 


What Next?
==========

The User Guide PDF will guide you gently into the product with some simple
examples, and then covers all the available Encoder options in detail.
Other topics such as license file creation and an API in the Loader are
also covered in later chapters. For a quick reminder when using the Encoder,
running it with the --help option will give a summary of all available options.

We hope you enjoy using and evaluating the product, and we can be contacted

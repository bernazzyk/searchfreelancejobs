accompanying USER-GUIDE PDF and also read the details here as they are specific
to this evaluation version of the Encoder.


FAQ FOR THE EVALUATION VERSION
------------------------------

* WHAT AM I EVALUATING?

The ionCube PHP Encoder is a sophisticated and highly versatile tool for 
processing PHP based products. This evaluation version of the Encoder has
all the features of our top product, the Cerberus Encoder. Features contained
in the Cerberus version that are not contained in the Basic Encoder include
the ability to restrict files to run on certain machines, the ability to set
expiry dates for files, and support for creating license files to do the same.


* WHAT SUPPORT DO YOU OFFER?

To help you to get the most from the evaluation version, our technical support
team will be happy to answer any questions that you may have relating to using
the Encoder effectively to meet your requirements, and to assist if you
experience any difficulties in usage.  Please visit http://support.ioncube.com
to open a ticket if required.


* WHAT IS DIFFERENT IN THE EVALUATION VERSION?

All features of the evaluation Encoder are functional, however:

1) Encoded files will expire after 36 hours, (or sooner if you encode files to
   expire earlier). Files can be encoded again to continue testing.

2) Encoded files contain a PHP comment to show they are encoded by the 
   evaluation Encoder. This text does not alter operation of encoded files, 
   and is not present in the release version. 


* HOW LONG IS THE EVALUATION PERIOD?

The evaluation version will be functional for 14 days.

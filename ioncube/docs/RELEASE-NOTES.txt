Version 7.0.2 - 25 Feb 2011
---------------------------

* GUI: The title bar now indicates if application restart is 
  required (after switching between legacy mode), and indicates
  if legacy encoding mode is in operation.

* GUI: Button added to browse for a custom error callback file
  within the project source tree.

* GUI: Alert to a license file incorrectly located within the install
  folder rather than the licensing folder.

* GUI: Version check option added to Help menu to check for any
  available software update.

* GUI: Fix to faulty command line generation when the custom header 
  comments text field contained a blank line.

* Fix for incorrect behaviour of --verify in the presence of 
  user-defined classes (PHP 5.3 Encoder).

* PDF: Documentation updates.


Version 7.0.1 - 13 Jan 2011
---------------------------

* Fix for issue that could affect temporary variables in files 
  encoded with the PHP 5.3 Encoder for certain mixed combinations
  of Encoder and Loader platforms (PHP 5.3 Encoder).

* Fix for use of unqualified global constants within namespaces
  (PHP 5.3 Encoder).


Version 7.0.0.3 - 13 Dec 2010
-----------------------------

* GUI: New feature added to support legacy encoding (6.5) as a user
  preference. This brand new feature is a compatibility maximiser,
  giving access to new features of the version 7 GUI while allowing 
  generation of legacy encoded files. Using the version 7 Encoder is
  recommended and is the default, but simply switch to legacy encoding
  using version 6.5 Encoders via the preferences dialog if needing to
  use encoded files to servers running old Loaders (pre version 4). 
  Note that as this feature uses version 6.5 Encoders, new features 
  of the version 7 Encoder (such as the @ syntax) are not available
  when legacy encoding is selected.

* Legacy command line Encoders (6.5) are now bundled with the
  version 7 Encoders for compatibility maximisation.


Version 7.0.0 - 24 Nov 2010
---------------------------

* The Encoder for the PHP 5.3 language is included in this release,
  plus the Encoders for PHP 5 < 5.3 and PHP 4.

* Source directory substitution in wildcard patterns using @

  A leading @/ or @\ in the values for --keep, --ignore, --encode,
  --copy and --encrypt is interpreted as being to the first source 
  item specified.

* Option --ignore-deprecated-warnings added to ignore deprecated
  warnings.

* Option --ignore-strict-warnings added to ignore strict language
  usage warnings.

* GUI: (File menu) The recent files and directories history now
  indicates if an item is missing, and gives an option to remove that
  item from the history.

* GUI: Accessibility enhancements.

* GUI: (Project menu) New options added to quick-build and clean the
  current project.  The build option will process as per the project
  settings with respect to whether an existing target is replaced,
  updated or merged.  Quick-build will perform an update operation 
  and only process files that are new or modified more recently than
  the corresponding item in the target folder. Note that a
  quick-build will not remove items in the target folder that do not
  appear in the source folder, so a clean or full build is
  recommended after changing the structure of the source folder.

* GUI: Preferences dialog added for project defaults and other
  settings.

* GUI: New toolbar icons added for moving to the next/previous parse 
  error within the associated file. When used, the document
  containing the error is opened, and if supported by the editor set
  via the preferences dialog, the cursor will be positioned at the
  line containing the error.

* GUI (user preference): The last open project can be automatically
  opened at startup.

* GUI: The PHP language used (4, 5, 5.3) is added as a visual check
  to the title bar information.

* GUI: Various bug fixes.

* GUI: Event log entries optimised to show shorter paths, and
  date/time display is available as a user preference.

* GUI: Source file edit/view. Source files can now be opened in a
  choice of editors both from the source files tree in project 
  settings and in the relevant nodes of the event tree. 
  The preferred editor is selected as a user preference from a list
  that currently includes: EditPlus 3, Notepad++, GVim, PSPad,
  Programmer's Notepad, PHP Edit or PHP Designer 2007. This list can
  be extended if required by editing an XML document located in the
  installation folder, using the exising entries as examples. 

  If an editor supports opening of a file at a particular position, 
  double clicking a parse error message in the event log will open
  the source file with the cursor positioned at the line containing
  the error.
  
* GUI: The export batch file option is replaced with an Export
  Project feature. This allows a project to be exported as a Windows
  batch file, a command line Encoder project file, or a Unix shell
  script. The exported project script can optionally be updated
  automatically when a project is saved.


Functional changes from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

* Encoded files produced by Encoder 7.0 require a minimum of Loader
  version 4.0 to function. 

* Encoding with strict language rules is now the default, and does
  not need to be enabled with --strict-php.  Deprecated warnings
  (new from PHP 5.3) are also enabled by default.

* New options --ignore-strict-warnings and
  --ignore-deprecated-warnings can be used to suppress strict and
  deprecated warnings.

* PHP 5 Encoder: Code with var instead of public/private/protected
  will no longer give a strict warning if strict warnings are
  enabled.

* GUI: New projects have strict language usage and deprecated
  warnings enabled by default in the project settings (miscellaneous
  tab).

* GUI: Menu and toolbar "Encode" options renamed as "Build" options.

* GUI: The "New Project" Wizard is removed for 7.0.0 and a new
  version will be added in a future revision.

* GUI: Loaders for Windows and Linux are no longer included with the
  product installation to reduce initial download size and to reduce
  the chance of obtaining out of date Loaders. If Loaders are
  required and/or the Loader bundling feature is desired to be used,
  the exact Loaders required can be easily downloaded and made
  available to the GUI after installation.  An "Add Loaders" link on
  the Target tab in project settings now provides a quick way to
  navigate to the relevant Loaders page on the ionCube website.
